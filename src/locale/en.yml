            Hi. <br>
            It is sad to say that, but PlaShiki is reaching its end of life.
            All the money left in project's budget will be directed towards our awesome moderators.
            <br><br>
            Thanks for your continuous support!

            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
                On all supported services on anime page there will appear a button
                which will take you directly to player. Also, there will appear a badge
                after nicknames/avatars of users who supported the project.
                <br/>
                Script is totally optional, application works just fine without it.
            </p>
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Install userscript manager. We recommend
                    <a href="$violentLink" target="_blank">ViolentMonkey</a>
                    or
                    <a href="$tamperLink" target="_blank">TamperMonkey</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Install <a href="http://plashiki.su/assets/plashiki.user.js" target="_blank">the script</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Refresh the page
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                If everything is fine, then the button that suggests installing the script will disappear from the side menu.
